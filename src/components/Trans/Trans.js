      Women deserve an equal voice in public discourse, that is a fact. The march on Washington was evidence that American women are a sleeping giant that needs to be awakened. We want equal pay for women, we want better educational opportunities for women of color and poor women, we need more women in politics. The "Woman's March" is a promising organization that undoubtedly wants all those things as well, which is exciting and invigorating. Here is the catch, when you are an activist for the rights of one minority and you associate, even praise, a person who has spent their adult life bashing other groups, we have a problem. When we're canceling marches because the predominant race of attendees is white women, we have a problem.

What I'm referring to, specifically, is Tamika Mallory's unfortunate response when Meghan McCain brought up her association and praise for Luis Farakhan. Also reports that marches were canceled because most of the marchers are caucasian have left a bad taste in people mouths from all political spectrums. Tamika, a smart and strong black woman, is the Co-President of the movement. She has previously referred to Luis Farrakhan as "GOAT" which is an acronym for "Greatest of all time."

The Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled Farakahn's Nation of Islam as a hate group. Their targets are exactly the same as white supremacists, Jews, and Queers. Mallory's association with Farrakhan is deeply troublesome for someone who is identifying as an activist for women. The main excuse that Farrakhan's defenders use to dismiss his homophobia and antisemitism is his kindness and generosity to black communities. Here's another person who was kind to their own race whilst launching a hate campaign against Jews and Queers: Hitler. Kindness for one group in tandem with dog-whistling hatred toward others is the quality of a deranged authoritarian. 

Tamika Mallory's refusal to condemn this man played right into conservative hands. All of a sudden conservative outlets are reporting on this as if they had been champions of the Jewish and Queer causes all along. It should leave the Women's March organization deeply concerned. It's more than just showing kindness to a bigot, or defending him on social media, or a tepid attend to distance herself on The View. What we have is the impression that Mallory is tone deaf myopic. 

At this point, Tamika must retract her statements of support for Farrakhan and apologize to the Jewish and Queer community for the GOAT statement. She had the opportunity to and did not. Instead what we saw was justifications for why her association to Farrakhan is no big deal to her. 

Activism is about love for a cause or community. I do not doubt that Tamika has a true and sincere passion for the plight of women. However, compassion should be part of activism as well. When she can't call bigots and tyrannical leaders out on their anti-semitism and homophobia it makes people question if Tamika's loyalties are to the cause, or to her pride, or to Farrakhan himself. 

This should be a wake-up call for the Women's March. Tamika should not resign, she should lovingly show those communities that she hurt that she is serious about building bridges. The way she behaved today on the view lacked solidarity and humility. Yes, I say that she hurt LGBT and Jewish communities. The GOAT thing is hurtful. PERIOD. The Democratic National Committee has now canceled their participation. I don't blame them.

      Vito Russo, gay activist and author of "The Celluloid Closet", is said to have uttered "Remember the Lesbians and what they did for us," before he died of AIDS-related complications. He was likely referring to the active roles that queer women played in providing healthcare solutions at the height of the epidemic. We've come a long way from the days where gay men infected with HIV/AIDS faced discrimination in healthcare. In 1981, when AIDS was known as a "gay cancer", there wasn't many healthcare professionals eager to help out in a time when the gay population was being decimated. Though being queer wasn't illegal in the United States, the significant amount of stigma involved in living an openly gay lifestyle suddenly intensified as even men who identified as heterosexual were also testing positive and dying. The contribution of lesbians during this period is one that is often underappreciated. 

Preventative measures like Prep and a more direct approach in safe sex discussions have been instrumental in thwarting new infections. Those that are living with HIV today have a greater chance of living a full and healthy life with medications. But many of the younger generations of queers are unable to fathom the degree of despair and uncertainty that came over our community when the AIDS epidemic exploded. AIDS patients were sometimes left to die painful deaths as the government and medical community brushed off the wider implications. Lesbians were amongst the teams of nurses and doctors that watched as the mainstream largely blamed gay men for AIDS. It was these queer women in healthcare roles who began to understand that AIDS was a disease that impacts all of us, whether or not one was infected personally, gay or straight, male or female. They were among the first who had compassion for those that were suffering. The sexual lifestyle of gay men was blamed for the epidemic and with that inferences that they were deserving of the disease. This manifested publically in homophobia and misinformation in healthcare.   

In New York, queer/lesbian organizations such as Act Up gathered to discuss solidarity with gay men infected and at risk of being infected. Marion Banzhaf and Alexis Danzig are two of the women who faced this crisis head-on as participants in Act Up.  1987 was almost a decade into the epidemic with no cure in sight and mounting deaths attributed to AIDS complications. Act Up began to brainstorm ways to battle the infection when society at large was turning its back. Providing clean needles to intravenous users, fighting for medications such as protease inhibitors, for example, were small yet significant ways in which this organization engaged in thoughtful cooperation and prevention. 

Both Banzhaff and Danzig were activists before they began their work with ACT UP, but it was their personal connection to the disease that inspired these women to tackle what was being called a gay man's disease. Banzhaff had forged friendships with gay men who had been part of the civil rights activism of the 60's and 70's and had died of AIDS in the early years. Danzig lost her father to AIDS in the late 80's and mentions that before the AIDS crisis, gay men and lesbian women were seen as separate species almost. Their work with ACT UP is a touching reminder that when people are dying, all we have is our community. During those times, we were queers helping each other get through it. This is a community mentality that we should continue to foster, even though it feels like we are largely out of the woods in this area. 

"It was never not my battle"

The observation that AIDS was especially detrimental for the poor, sex workers, and people of color made this fight more imperative for Danzig and Banzhaf. You can visit Act Up's archives and their modern websites. 

New York and San Francisco saw the mobilization of queer women in urban areas that were being hit the hardest by the AIDS crisis. In Utah, where religious communities often shunned individuals who were testing positive and dying of AIDS, the stakes were higher. Even in this region of the country, lesbians were engaging in compassionate care for their gay brothers. The 2018 Logo film, Quiet Heroes, chronicles the story of  Kristen Reis, MD, and her physician assistant and partner Maggie Snyder. The women talk about the challenges that they faced in providing care to gay men in a region where AIDS was seen as divine retribution for sin. I've watched the teaser for the film and I do get emotional with that little bit.  The film was screened earlier in the year at the Sundance Film Festival and premiered in August on Logo.  I've sent a message to inquire about when this film might be available for further viewing. I will update this as soon as I hear back.

      Last week, Nova premiered an episode about the science of addiction. The documentary delves into the lives of individuals that are suffering in the throes of opiate and heroin dependency. Perhaps the most compelling of the science is the notion that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a key role in triggering addictive behavior. This is not limited to opioids but also eating, sex, cigarettes, alcohol etc. It is a true scientific advancement to show that a brain exposed to long-term drug addiction becomes depleted of dopamine, which then becomes the chief driver of higher and deadlier doses. This documentary is impactful because it paints a picture of addiction mischaracterized as a criminal issue when it is a medical issue in actuality. And though Nova is effective in pinning down the hard science behind addiction, it ignores that statistically there are populations that are more prone to addictive disorders. The LGBTQ population is among these. 
In fact, being a queer person doubles the chances that addiction could play a role in behavior according to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, LGBTQ adolescents consume more alcohol on average. The prevalence of comorbidity, or presence of concurrent mental health disorders, in LGBT populations, complicates these facts and has contributed to behavioral health concerns such as self-harm, eating disorders, or suicide. Taking these statistics into account can play into the notion that the queer community is damaged, which is a charge that has been leveled against sexual minorities for centuries. But these statistics are really indicative of a population faced with increased social, political, and economic threats. Marginalization of minorities harms everyone, especially when health care is involved. In the United States, healthcare costs nearly doubled from 1980 to 2014 with a 6% higher deviation over 10 other developed countries. Though, America ranks last in areas such as health care outcomes and access. Sidestepping that there are sections of the population that are more prone to medical conditions would be inadvisable because it will sustain the trend of increasing costs and decreased the quality of care. The first step toward changing these trends involve admitting to ourselves as a nation that addiction is a medical issue and then electing public officials that are committed to upholding that. Fat chance. Until then uninsured, underinsured, and poor populations in the queer community are at higher risks for overdoses and other harm caused by untreated addiction disorders.
Though the science of addiction and the role that dopamine plays in the furthering of addictive behavior have biological drivers, the factors that contribute to the increased prevalence of addictive behavior in LGBTQ populations have societal foundations as well. I can hear some people saying, “It’s 2018, no one cares if you’re gay, lesbian, transgender, or bisexual.” However, the social pressure from religious organizations, social mores that punish otherness, and discrimination rooted in a lack of proper attention to educating society at large remain strongholds in the United States and abroad. The case of James Miller, a man from Austin Texas who brutally stabbed a gay man using a gay panic defense, is a clear example. That is just one of several that illustrate that queer-phobia is alive and well and harming newer generations of the LGBTQ community. 
New approaches to addiction address the growing evidence that abstinence and 12-step programs have chinks in their armor and indicate that more comprehensive medical treatments are required. In Vancouver, as Nova highlights, there are centers where heroin addicts can have their drugs tested for impurities first and then shoot up under the supervision of a medical professional, which has led to lower HIV rates and a decrease in overdoses. Other initiatives aim to provide clean needles to addicts to reduce the transmitting of diseases. What has yet to be addressed is a comprehensive approach to preventing, thwarting, or delaying addictive behavior in sexual minorities that are more susceptible to seek a quick escape. Scaling back of rights of any minority is a weapon that is deployed with the intent to harm, holding back or limiting medical care is a weapon that is meant to kill. If there’s one thing that we’ve learned from the CIA’s involvement in the 1980’s crack epidemic in communities of color is that there are more than one way to take down a community. We’re not suggesting that the spooks are in on the opiate or meth epidemics as they have been shown to be involved with the distribution of crack cocaine. However, we are identifying that the avoidance of factors that contribute to sexual minority addiction can contribute to the decimation of our numbers. It is vital to identify the risk factors within our community and promote conscientious and steady changes over time.
