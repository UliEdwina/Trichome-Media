        <p>You don't have to go back in time too long to see what happens when the military excludes a section of the population or treats minorities differently. Very often discriminatory practices in the military inevitably end up vanquished in the courts or by legislation. We've sited here that during WW2 the integration of blacks into the military was seen as problematic by bigots and racists in government. Bias was also at the center of the fight to allow gay men and women to serve openly without the fear of reprisal of removal from their military post. The integration of women in combat roles was, similarly, a barrier rooted in a baseless fear that it was a threat to readiness. Here were are again trying to find out if allowing transgender people to serve openly would hurt America's military. 

We will point out once more that the Pentagon has already published a study that cleared transgender troops for duty, even if they require hormone replacement therapy. But that was during the Obama years, which was also the one that struck down the Clinton era "compromise" on gays: Don't ask Don't Tell. But this is the Trump era. Trump has so far been successful in his war against Transgender Troops. Nevermind that Trump forgets which branch of the military he's addressing, or that he reportedly referred to military service in Vietnam as "stupid," and has disparaged a POW saying, "I like it when they don't get caught." If you put all of that aside, there is still the possibility that neither Trump not his staff has sat down and actually talked to transgender service members. There are roughly around 2... currently serving, not to mention the scores of transgender veterans in the population, of which I am one. 

The recent decision by the Pentagon is to give transgender servicemembers and potential recruits the chance to serve but only if they serve in their assigned sex, as per the White House. The original tweet that ignited this disgraceful display of prejudice and transphobia called for a blanket exclusion of transgender people period. After one court struck down the ban and another ruled that there is no actual "ban" if trans people are allowed to serve openly but in their biological sex, the court has allowed the ban to proceed. It is scheduled to start on April 12th.

Sparta Pride is an advocacy group spearheaded by Captain Jennifer Peace, who is a transgender servicemember, suggested that Trump and Pence should speak with trans troops directly. Peace is also pushing for the Senate Armed Services Committee to actually hear out the troops that this ban will impact. 

“Sitting opposite us, we don’t seem as ‘other’ and different, but your soldiers who you’ve been charged to take care of and be responsible for. It makes all the difference. We are just soldiers. There is absolutely no one I wouldn’t talk to about this. I want them to know, ‘Here’s who we are and what we do every day, and we are no different to anyone else and no less capable than anyone else. And please, just let us do our jobs."

Therein we have to wonder if the Trump/Pence administration views transgender people with equal rights and priveledges. Pence's animosity toward the LGBT traces back into his days in Congress. Trump, in my opinion, isn't homophobic or transphobic per-say. Rather his animosity stinks of self-preservation, just like everything he does actually. </p>

     <p> Remember when Kelly Anne Conway created "alternative facts"? Or when Sean Spicer tried to convince everyone that Trump's inaugural crowd was the largest ever. What's most alarming are the scores of people swallowing the blatant lies that Trump throws out almost on a daily basis. Lies, after all, are a two-way street. There's the person who lies and the person who believed the lies. People want and expect the truth no matter which way you slice it. 

The Trumps are people that seem to thrive on lie upon lie. Ivanka Trump went on television and said that she knew "almost nothing" about the Trump Tower Moscow deal, even though she was planning a spa named after her as part of the agreement. Not to mention, she and Michael Cohen took a trip to Moscow together. "Almost Nothing", my ass! She's lying. 

It would be easy to assume that there's some kind of genetic component to the liberty that the Trumps take with the truth.  It does seem to be that they're so "extra" about the falsehoods they produce. Take the payoffs to the porn star and play-mate as another example. The science of lying, however, is very advanced and points to one stark fact: We're all liars. 

Lies outrage everyone. How many times have you heard someone say, "I can tolerate lots of things, but lying...no ma'am." Another one of my favorites is when people say, "I don't lie." Lie! Because, honey, lying is as human as sex. </p>

      <p>It's becoming evident that the Democratic Presidential primary features the most diverse pool of candidates this country has ever seen. There are now two women officially running, with two or three still mulling a run. We have a Chicano and former mayor of San Antonio, Julian Castro, vying for the nomination. Last week Cory Booker officially threw his hat in the ring. For the first time ever there is also an openly gay millennial running as well. But does he have a chance?</p>

<p>Peter Buttigieg, or Mayor Pete, is a 37-year-old Afghanistan war veteran with an impressive resume. Mayor Pete was born Peter Montgomery Buttigieg (Boot-edge-edge) on January 19, 1982 in South Bend Indiana. He graduated from Harvard in 2004 with BA in History and Literature. In 2012 Buttigieg became the youngest, and gayest, person to be elected mayor in South Bend Indiana. After he was sworn in as mayor, Buttigieg enlisted in the Navy reserve and volunteered for a seven-month deployment to Afghanistan in support Operation Enduring Freedom. </p>

<p>Buttigieg is a living an example of a queer person thriving in spaces where cis-gendered heterosexuals have been dominating (which is pretty much everywhere). He serves as a positive role model for queer youth with aspirations for higher office. The real question for 2020 is whether the Democratic nominee can beat Trump. He is definitely qualified, but that doesn't mean anything anymore. That is where Buttigieg enters as an underdog. </p>

<p>His marriage to his husband Chasten Glezman is a picture-perfect portrait of a power couple that is ready and willing to rise up the political ranks. Even though Barrack Obama has praised Buttigieg as an up and coming star in the Democratic party, his specific views on issues are still a mystery. There are certain positions that will be nearly impossible for a Democrat to shy away from in their bid to clinch the nomination. The first and most vital, in my opinion, is climate change. With Trump having his head up his ass on this topic, these Democratic presidential candidates have to come out swinging in that area. Another major topic that any candidate running as a Democrat will have to define is homeland security and foreign policy. In other words, Buttigieg cannot rely solely on his queer identity and youth. I can hear Michelle Visage say, "Stop Relying on Those Youthful Good Looks." </p>
